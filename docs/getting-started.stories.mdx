# Avail Design System

The avail design system is made up of small UI packages that can be mostly imported into projects as needed. This allows updating a package to happen without worrying about breaking changes that might be in development on another components.

| Package                  | Exports                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| @rent_avail/autocomplete | Address Autocomplete                                |
| @rent_avail/avatar       | Avatar, Avatar Group                                |
| @rent_avail/core         | Provider, Box, Grid, Col, Container, Flex           |
| @rent_avail/controls     | Button, Checkbox, Input, Radio, Radio Group, Switch |
| @rent_avail/dialog       | Confirmation Dialog, Fullscreen Dialog              |
| @rent_avail/feedback     | Inline Feedback, Fullscreen Feedback                |
| @rent_avail/menu         | Menu                                                |
| @rent_avail/popover      | Popover                                             |
| @rent_avail/progress     | Fluid Progress, Fixed Progress                      |
| @rent_avail/select       | Select Input                                        |
| @rent_avail/skeleton     | Skeleton Loader                                     |
| @rent_avail/tag          | Tag                                                 |
| @rent_avail/toast        | Toast                                               |
| @rent_avail/tooltip      | Tooltip                                             |

## Getting Started

Install the design system and peer dependencies

```bash
yarn add react react-dom styled-components @doors/core
```

Bootstrap your react app and in the root component import the `ThemeProvider` from `@rent_avail/core`

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@rent_avail/core"

const customTheme = {}

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <Routes />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

Now you're ready to start using layout components to quickly build complex UIs.

```jsx
import { Card, Container } from "@rent_avail/core"

const cardBackgrounds = [
  "blue_100",
  "blue_300",
  "blue_500",
  "blue_700",
  "blue_900",
]

function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <Box as="main" my="4rem">
      <Container as={Stack}>
        {cardBackgrounds.map((bg) => (
          <Card key={bg} sx={{ bg }} />
        ))}
      </Container>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

## Style Objects

The ADS (Avail Design System) uses [`styled-system`](https://styled-system.com) to help you quickly build custom components with constraint based styles. All components--unless otherwise noted--accept an `sx` prop that is a style object supercharged with theme powers. This method let's you leverage the consistency of our theme while allowing you to override when needed to.

```jsx
function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <Card
      sx={{
        my: "4rem",
        p: "4rem",
        bg: "blue_100",
      }}
    >
      I'm a card with a margin top and bottom of 4rem, a padding of 4rem, and a
      background of our brand color blue_100.
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Nested & Psuedo Selectors

You can nest selectors in the sx prop in much the same way as scss. This also works for pseudo selectors and elements.

```jsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        position: "relative",
        "&::before": {
          content: '""',
          width: "100%",
        },
        "& span": {
          color: "ui_500",
        },
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

**Note**
For before and after psuedo elements, you'll need to wrap the content value in double quotes because of how styled object keys are parsed.

`content: '""';`

## Responsive Styles

Styled system allows us to responsively style our ui components with array props. All styled props accept an array that will map to the breakpoints in the theme spec.

```jsx
<Box
  sx={{
    width: ["100%", "50%", "33%"],
    color: ["brand.primary", "brand.secondary"],
  }}
>
  This box will take up 100% of it's parent on small screens, then 50% on the
  next largest breakpoint, and 33% after that. It will also switch colors from
  the primary to secondary brand colors as the screen grows in size.
</Box>
```
