```js
import { Box, Card, Container, Stack, Grid, Col } from "@rent_avail/layout"
```

The layout package combines a number or useful primitive components to quickly build layouts and complex UI.

## Box

A box is the most basic component in this system. It's a drop in replacement for a `div` and can be used as the backbone of any element with the `as` prop.

#### Style Props

`space, layout, color, flexbox, background, border`

#### Props

No component props

#### Usage

```jsx live
<Box bg="blue_100" p="1rem">
  I'm a light blue box with 1rem of padding.
</Box>
```

---

## Card

A card is a special flavor of box. Cards contain information and actions about a single subject. Cards should be scannable for relevant information. Elements like text and images should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

#### Style Props

`space, layout, color, flexbox, background, border`

#### Component Props

No component props

#### Usage

```jsx live
<Card>
  <Heading as="h3">Rent Collection</Heading>
  <Text>This is an overview of your rent collection across units.</Text>
</Card>
```

---

## Container

Containers are used to prevent the layout from becoming unusable on large scale screens. They have a max-width and automatically center to their parent. They should be used sparingly as a deeply nested part of a layout.

#### Style Props

`space, layout, grid, flexbox`

#### Component Props

No component props

#### Usage

```jsx live
<Container>
  <Box bg="blue_300" p="2rem" color="gold_100">
    I won't get wider than 80rem
  </Box>
</Container>
```

---

## Stack

Stacks are used to easily layout a list of items, it takes care of a standard spacing in between each item using css `gap`. There are two variants of stacks, vertical and horizontal.

#### Style Props

`space, layout, grid, flexbox`

#### Variants

| Variant    | Description                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Horizontal | Items will stretch horizontally until they need to break onto a new line. |
| Vertical   | Items will stretch vertically. **This is the default variant**            |

#### Component Props

No component props.

#### Usage

```jsx live
<Stack>
  {[0, 1, 2, 3].map((num) => (
    <Box key={num} bg="blue_500" color="blue_100" p="2rem">
      {num}
    </Box>
  ))}
</Stack>
```

## Grids

Grids are built as an easy starting point for more custom layout patterns. The `<Grid />` component should always contain `<Col />` components as immediate children. Grids are divided into 12 columns of equal length with a 2rem gutter in between each. The number of columns each `<Col />` takes up can be changed with the `span` (or `gridRow`) props.

#### Style Props (shared by both elements)

`color, grid, flexbox, space, layout`

#### Grid Component Props

| name    | type     | description                     |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| columns | `number` | Shorthand way to define columns |

#### Style Component Props

| name    | type           | description                |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| span    | `array\string` | Shorthand for `gridColumn` |
| spanRow | `array\string` | Shorthand for `gridRow`    |

#### Usage

```jsx live
<Grid>
  <Col span="3" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span="3" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span="3" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span="3" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span={[12, 4]} bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span={[12, 4]} bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span={[12, 4]} bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span="6" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
  <Col span="6" bg="blue_500" height="4rem"></Col>
</Grid>
```
