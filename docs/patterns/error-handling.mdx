# Error Handling

There are three types of errors that users will encounter while online. `Field Errors`, `Form Errors`, and `Application Errors`. Ideally the application is designed to minimize errors--the best error state is one never experienced--by building flexible user controls that use affordances to enhance user understanding.

#### Error Examples

- When a user input is not understood.
- Data failing to load on a page.
- Processes running in the wrong order, causing data to become malformed.

### Field Errors

**The submit button should be enabled by default.**

Help users fix errors as soon as they're detected. Disable the submission of a form if the error is present and if detected after the attempted submission, clearly illustrate **where** the error happened and **how** to fix it.

These types of errors are the most common and come in two variaties.

#### Client Errors

<br />

```jsx live
function ClientError() {
  const re = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Stanley's Email")
  const [error, setError] = useState("Email address is invalid.")
  async function handleChange({ target }) {
    const valid = target.value.match(re)
    if (valid) {
      setError(null)
    }
    setValue(target.value)
  }
  async function handleBlur({ target }) {
    const valid = target.value.match(re)
    if (!valid) setError("Email address is invalid.")
    else setError(null)
  }
  return (
    <Input
      label="Email"
      value={value}
      onBlur={handleBlur}
      onChange={handleChange}
      error={error}
    />
  )
}
```

Client errors check for valid syntax. These can happen before the user attempts to submit a form. They should appear on blur and disappear as soon as the user has fixed the error.

#### Server Errors

Server errors can be returned for a myriad of reasons, uniqueness and incompatible data being the two big ones. If performing inline validation, where the error occured should be abundantly clear.

<br />

```jsx live
function ServerError() {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)
  return (
    <Box
      as="form"
      sx={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        alignItems: "flex-end",
      }}
      onSubmit={(ev) => {
        ev.preventDefault()
        setError(`Must be older than ${ev.target.age.value} to register`)
      }}
    >
      <Input
        label="Current Age"
        width="100%"
        type="number"
        name="age"
        onChange={(e) => {
          setError(null)
        }}
        error={error}
      />
      <Button variant="primary" type="submit" disabled={error}>
        Register
      </Button>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

### Form Errors

Form errors are things that can't be tied back to an individual field. These happen when a user attempts to submit a form and an error returns from the server. It may be helpful to think of these as _base_ errors.

For example, a form error might occur a tenant tries to make a payment for a charge that no longer exists. This submission wouldn't process, but the tenant didn't fill anything out incorrectly.

For these situations, it's important to let a user know that something went wrong and if there's a chance to remidate the situation, how to take it.

<br />

```jsx live
function FormError() {
  const [error, setError] = useState(false)
  return (
    <Grid>
      <Col
        error={error}
        span={[6]}
        as={Input}
        label="Email"
        autoComplete="off"
      />
      <Col
        span={[6]}
        as={Input}
        error={error}
        label="Password"
        type="password"
        autoComplete="new-password"
      />
      <Col span={[12]}>
        <Button onClick={(e) => setError(true)}>Log in</Button>
      </Col>
      {error && (
        <Box
          as={motion.div}
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: "1rem", x: "-50%" }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: "0rem" }}
          sx={{
            p: "2rem",
            borderRadius: 4,
            border: "1px solid transparent",
            borderColor: "red_500",
            bg: "red_300",
            position: "fixed",
            top: "2rem",
            left: "50%",
            width: "100%",
            maxWidth: "40rem",
            zIndex: 9999,
          }}
        >
          <Box sx={{ display: "flex", mb: "1rem" }}>
            <Box>An Error Occured</Box>
            <Box
              as={Icon.X}
              sx={{ ml: "auto", cursor: "pointer" }}
              onClick={(e) => setError(false)}
            />
          </Box>
          <Box>That email / password combination is not correct</Box>
        </Box>
      )}
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

### Application Errors

Application errors are the most general error types that a user can experience and are sometimes caused by things outside the users control.

The goal with application errors is to notify the user and if possible let them continue on with their task. This means working offline for as long as possible and making sure that components are built in a way that means an error in one part of the page doesn't effect the rest of it.

These should look and feel a lot like form errors but they don't have to be connected to a user event.

export function ApplicationError() {
  const toast = useToast()
  const [ref, { isIntersecting }] = useIntersection()
  const [hasIntersected, setIntersected] = useState(false)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!hasIntersected) {
      setIntersected(isIntersecting)
      if (isIntersecting)
        toast.error(
          "You've lost internet connection. Just kidding, you've just scrolled to the end of the page."
        )
    }
  }, [isIntersecting])
  return <Box ref={ref} sx={{ minHeight: "4rem" }} />
}

<ApplicationError />
