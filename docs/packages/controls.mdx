This package contains a set of elements that allow a user to control state on a page.

## Button

```jsx live
<Stack direction={["row"]} flexWrap="wrap" mt="-2rem">
  <Button mt="2rem">default</Button>
  <Button mt="2rem" variant="primary">
    primary
  </Button>
  <Button mt="2rem" variant="danger">
    danger
  </Button>

  </Button>
</Stack>
```

### Description

Buttons at Avail have uppercase text labels. Buttons come with two variants baked in and are extendable in whatever way you wish. The default button should be used the most. It is seen as clickable without being too distracting. If you have a set of buttons together use the primary button to distinguish the most desirable action.

#### Style Props

`color, space, layout, flexbox, border, buttonStyle`
